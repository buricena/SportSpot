## SportSpot - Full Responsive Page Coding
 

For this assignment, we created **high-fidelity prototypes** for both desktop and mobile versions of the SportSpot landing page. The design follows the principles covered in the course.  


- The page is **responsive**, ensuring optimal display and usability across different screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktop screens.
- Key sections such as the **Hero**, **Search Bar**, **How It Works**, **Events Around You**, and **Footer** have been designed and coded with responsiveness in mind.  

The application is deployed and publicly accessible at:
