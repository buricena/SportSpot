🌱 Inspiration

Through conversations with friends and acquaintances, we discovered that many people find out about local sports activities through WhatsApp groups or word of mouth.
However, not everyone knows these groups exist — making it easy to miss opportunities to join games or tournaments.

That’s why we created SportSpot — a simpler, more accessible solution for discovering, joining, and organizing sports events without needing to be “in the right group.”
SportSpot helps bring the local sports community together and makes staying active easier for everyone.
