## SportSpot - Dynamic Routes

We have implemented **dynamic routing** in the SportSpot Next.js app.

- The **Homepage** (`/`) contains navigation links to **Discover, Events, Map, and Results** pages.
- Each page is handled as a separate route using Next.js routing.

The application is deployed on Vercel and accessible at:
